<h2>XF.touch</h2>

<p><code>XF.touch</code> makes the life in such a multidevice world easier â€” it is an adapter for all types of user contexts: touch screens, mouse, pointers.</p>

<p>For now it contains the following user interaction events:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>tap</code>: it doesn't matter if it is a click or a touch to the screen. Just bind on tap events for all types of devices and that's it! <code>XF.touch</code> fixes the 300ms gap between click and touch events as well</li>
<li><code>swipe</code>, <code>swipeUp</code>, <code>swipeDown</code>, <code>swipeLeft</code>, <code>swipeRight</code></li>
</ul>
