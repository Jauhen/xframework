<h2>What is XFramework?</h2>

<p>Version 0.9.1</p>

<p>XFramework (next XF) is a small yet powerful Javascript framework for quick development of cross-device web applications. Honestly saying, XF is a high-level framework based on <a href="http://backbonejs.org">Backbone.js</a> that implements its own architecture paradigm, based on MV* on the component level.</p>

<p>XFramework makes it easy to reuse the application logic and provide various layouts or widgets for different devices based on the criteria that you define.</p>

<p>XFramework is designed to be extremely modular, flexible, fast, and easy to use. To develop an app in X-Framework a developer should be familiar with common web technologies such as HTML/CSS/JS, LESS for editing styles, Handlebars-style templating and have an understanding of how MV* architecture works. Experience using Backbone.js, Angular.js, Ember.js, jQuery Mobile or other framework will be helpful.</p>

<p><em>TODO: update!</em><br />XFramework currently features:</p>

<ul>
<li>TOTALLY CROSS-PLATFORM. XF supports all the popular devices and platroms. It is built in the way that allows you easily to change templates for each of the platforms without huge effort.</li>
<li>SCALABLE ARCHITECTURE. Component-based modular event-driven architecture provides a possibility to build scalable and maintainable web apps with high-reusability of components.</li>
<li>CUTE &amp; CUSTOMIZABLE. XF uses LESS as preprocessor for CSS. It goes with a default theme that could be easily customized changing some lines of CSS code.</li>
<li>LIBRARY OF COMPONENTS. Reusability is a king! XF is flexible and extandable to the roots: it goes with a library of predefined components but feel free to write your own components and submit it to us!</li>
<li>POWERFUL RICH UI-ELEMENTS. Set of powerful rich UI-elements (e.g. form elements, buttons, lists) for different platforms gives a ability to provide the best user experience for each device type. And the number of UI-elements s growing!</li>
<li>FLEXIBILITY TO FEEL THE FREEDOM. Build process allows you to create a custom build of XFramework and use it together with your favorite UI-library like <a href="http://jquerymobile.com">jQuery Mobile</a> or <a href="http://maker.github.io/ratchet/">Ratchet</a>.</li>
